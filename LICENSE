Ask us? ☺  
DRAFT:

1. Personal use: 
This was made for you ♡  If you like it consider donating. Our work is efficient.
(if you modify or add anything: Please take the time to post it in our Repo or tell us? ☺  Should you find any parts relevant in a different context, we are curious/amazed too)

2. Contributors: 
Accepted pull requests: You are a shareholder of this project / 'cooperative'. Proportional to the time well spent.
Please feel free to vote about our actions.

3. Publishers:  
Unmodified Distribution welcome! permitted.   (don't wrap it in 'installation assistents' / drive-by installs)
 
4. Charity/NGO:  
Link to us prominently. Or ask.

5. Commercial and modified:  (Except: OS's, Open Source Initiativ, Debian, Fedora)
Written permission/contract required.  No such permission was granted. 
However popular commercial projects keep using our code without permission. Some who feature adware / spyware 

(Meaningful modified commercial re-publishing is not expectable at all.
However publishing as a package in Operating Systems makes extactly the same sense as with a GNU license!)

(No warranty / liablity)

Thank you
